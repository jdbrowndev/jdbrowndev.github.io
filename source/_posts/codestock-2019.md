Knoxville's CodeStock 2019 is a wrap! This was my 4th year attending. A few notable talks:

- [Maarten Balliauw](https://blog.maartenballiauw.be/talk/2019/04/12/codestock-exploring-net-memory-management-trip-down-memory-lane.html) gave an excellent presentation on .NET memory management. The presentation slides provide an overview of the CLR's garbage collector along with helpful examples for diagnosing memory issues.
- [Jeff Fritz](https://twitter.com/csharpfritz) showed off his Twitch stream for live coding and promoting CS education.
- [Jeremy Likness](https://blog.jeremylikness.com/presentation-webassembly-c-and-blazor-at-codestock-2019-ab2f8636356) presented Blazor / WebAssembly as a means of running C# code in the browser. This technology is still in preview but may have potential to take off in the next few years. I'm especially interested in WebAssembly as a means of porting games into the browser.

Thanks to all the speakers! Looking forward to Knoxville BSides 2019 next month.

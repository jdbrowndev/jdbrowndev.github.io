With so many tech conferences canceled due to the global pandemic, I am very glad to have had the opportunity to attend this year's virtual Knoxville BSides 2020! The talks offered excellent insight into the cyber security world that I don't often get to experience as a software developer.

My favorite talks:

- [The Long Con: Surviving 25+ years in InfoSec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w53q0pHcDo&feature=youtu.be) by Xavier Ashe gave advice on how to maintain healthy work habits in a stressful environment. Many of the concepts explored are applicable outside of the security industry.
- [A Hillbilly's Guide to Staying Anonymous Online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPEboNcV_ak) by Adam Compton discussed methods to prevent our personal information from being stolen and/or shared online.
- [Negotiating with Ransomware Attackers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJtSWjzzu-I) by Tony Rucci provided an in-depth look into ransomware along with strategies to negotiate with the attackers themselves.
